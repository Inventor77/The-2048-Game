# The-2048-Game

2048 is a simple and enjoyable puzzle game. Even if you are not a fan of numbers, you will like this game. It's played on a 4x4 and 8x8 grid with the arrow keys or the W, A, S, and D keys. When you press a key, all of the tiles slide. Tiles with the same value that collide are blended together. Even if there is an ideal method for playing, there is always some element of chance. If you've completed the game and want to master it, try to do so with a lower score. That would imply that you completed the game with fewer moves.
